Hazelcast is a distributed computation and storage platform for consistently low-latency querying, aggregation, and stateful computation against event streams and traditional data sources. It allows you to quickly build resource-efficient, real-time applications.

Hazelcast can process data on a set of networked and clustered computers that pool together their random access memories (RAM) to let applications share data with other applications running in the cluster. When data is stored in RAM, applications run a lot faster since it does not need to be retrieved from disk and put into RAM prior to processing. Using Hazelcast, you can store and process your data in RAM, spread and replicate it across a cluster of machines; replication gives you resilience to failures of cluster members.

Hazelcast Essentials:
Working with data - lots of data - exists in lots of places - real-time data, historical data - business needs instance data - makes the application faster when the data is processed faster

challenge with real-time data -> constantly updating -> haze last ingests data in motion, enriches data at rest, and reduces latency of sending data back and forth
