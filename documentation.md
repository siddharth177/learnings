Exercise: New Product or Service that improves the airline pre-flight experience

What is the biggest pain point of flight onboarding?
    1. Checkin Time: It's usually around 1 hour
    -> We can create a service that continuously monitors the crowd for checking in at a terminal for that airline. It will help passengers decide when to reach the airport


Design Thinking
    -> Developing a deep understanding of people's goals and creating experiences that match those.
    -> What people want to achieve and how they want to feel after achieving those.
    -> You need to be clear about people's goals.
    -> Help people meet their goals -> create passionate advocates

Design Thinking Process
1. Understand: Who is it for and what are their goals? (Understanding the geographic)
    -> Interview them to understand personas
3. Envision: How can we help them meet their goals?
    -> Brainstorming techniques 
5. Prototype: How could it work?
   -> Test it on the real audience
