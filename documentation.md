Exercise: New Product or Service that improves the airline pre-flight experience

What is the biggest pain point of flight onboarding?
    1. Checkin Time: It's usually around 1 hour
    -> We can create a service that continuously monitors the crowd for checking in at a terminal for that airline. It will help passengers decide when to reach the airport


Design Thinking
-> problem-solving     approach
    -> Developing a deep understanding of people's goals and creating experiences that match those.
    -> What people want to achieve and how they want to feel after achieving those.
    -> You need to be clear about people's goals to make their experience better.
    -> Help people meet their goals -> create passionate advocates

Design Thinking Process
1. Understand: who are we solving the problem for?
   ->  Who is it for and what are their goals? (Understanding persons persona)
    -> Interview them to understand personas
3. Envision: How can we help them meet their goals?
    -> Brainstorming techniques 
5. Prototype: How could it work?
   -> Test it on the real audience
   -> visual narrative on how your solutin will work and show it to first few user to get feedback/

Set objectives for each process. and design questions, and steps to achieve those objectives.

1. Understand
   -> Identify Research Objectives
       - We need to do some planning - what do you want to learn - who do you want to interview - how will you structure interview? to get fruteful result from research
       - Objectives could be around (to give reserach focus and learn about audience) - consider what situations about audience you wnat to learn - their motivation - their current knowledge - their behaviour - decision making process - goals

   -> Plan who to interview - primarry and secondary audience - how they react to the solution - understand who are the target audience
   - think different types of people who could use your product, how much they use the product, their work profile, demograpghy, diversities
   - where you can find those file. Friends and family, existing customers, personal network, hire a recruting firm, place ads, man on the street interviews

-> Ask the right questions
    - take a list on objectives, 
    - people can't talk about their problems, experiences properly
    - story telling is best way to get the information you want
    - ask open ended questions (how , what and why)
    - how did you plan your day to get prepared for this? was this expereince hard for you?
    “How do you…?”
“What is it like to…?”
“Why do you feel…?”
“Can you tell me about a time when…?”
